# Tank
Tank Game in Python (uses pygame library)

This python game uses pygame to implement a single user game that includes robot tanks, barriers, mines etc. The object of the game is for the controlled yellow tank to kill the red tank without being killed.

The right and left arrow keys rotate the turret on the yellow tank.  The up arrow increases the speed. The down arrow slows it down.  The
'end' key shoots.  

The robot tanks lock on to a random target and try to kill it. Their gun range is shorter than the range of the yellow tank.
