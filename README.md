# Tank
Tank Game in Python (uses pygame library)

This python game uses pygame to implement a  robot game that includes robot tanks, barriers, mines etc.  The object of the all robot version is to fight a war using only robot logic.  The parameters of the game are set up in the initialization code in the mainline. 

The robot tanks lock on to a target and try to kill it. The smaller robots gun range is shorter than the range of the larger
tanks.

In the current release all tanks are robots and the red and yellow robot logic is broken out separately to test the effectiveness of 
various robot control logic. 

The up arrow increases the speed of the game. The down arrow slows it down. The space key temporarily pauses the game for review of the 
situation.
